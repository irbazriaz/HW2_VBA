# HW2_VBA
This is Module 2(VBA) HW for Bootcamp.

We have created a VBA script for Stock Market Analysis in 2014, 2015, 2016

The easy challenge was to create 
          -Four separate columns: (1)Ticker (2)Yearly Change (3)Percent Change and (4)Total
          -Calculate yearly change, percent change and total stock vol for each of the tickers in the datasets

The moderate challenge was to color render according to increase or decrease in yearly change
          - Green color for increase in yearly change
          - Red color for decrease in yearly change
          
The hard challenge was to create three additional columns with three rows to
          - Calculate maximum increase in yearly change
          - Calculate minimum decrease in yearly change
          - Calculate greatest total stock volume
          - Corresponding tickers for each of the aforementioned calculation
